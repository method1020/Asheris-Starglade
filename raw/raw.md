## Tuesday 8/29

* use shell to call up to the guy in the tower. the guy tells us to get off the beach, its not safe down here.
* i tell the group and we run up to the wall.
* guy on the wall throws a rope ladder over the side.
* kuran is trying to bring the laughing pigmi with him up the wall.
* ash recognizes the uniform as the 'town guard' -- the crest of the town is on his chest.
* Simon is the guard.
* From simon
  * the rift has been getting bigger.
  * sometimes weird breatures come through the rift
  * some wizards were researching but they got injured.
* aleric remembers about rifts, and knows they typically there is something holind them closed.
  * there have been rifts like this before, usually there is something keeping it from growing, but something hasn't stopped this one.
* ash asks where 
  * there is a labritory in town that has been locked up since one of the wizards died.
  * coreen probably has keys
  * robertos body was probably sent back to candle keep.
    * candlekeep is is a place ... another bigger town.
* simon asks if we are working with the forttins, or baron pinkwell.
* we are free agents.
* simon wants us to go back and see coreen.
* leads us to a house by the enterance to town.
* simon takes off his armor when he gets to the house, he seems comfortable there.
* white mohawk ,eye patch over right eye.
* we relay to her how we ended up on the beach.
* simon tells her that we won over the chule.
* sareen looks us over, but fixates on d3puty.
* d3puty offers her services.
* belvins layer
* roberto was sent to candlekeep
* belvin probably got murdered by pygmies.
* we offer to close up the rift.
* simon thinks it might be going to the plane of shadows. -- kind of like the fairies but the dark ones. not the upside down.
* we rest and go to the lab.
* kuran walks away with the pigme and check his pockets ,find some random trinkets.
* kuran tries to intimidate the pigme.
* the pigme is scared and yelling at kuran in a language he doesn't understand.
* kuran comes back with a scared and pale lookign pigme.
* simon guides us up on a road around town to a tower.
* on hte way we see an abandoned camp. looks like there is some smithing equipment at the forge.
* the tower is taller than the trees
* ash and aleric look around. there is noticable nasty green algy on all the rocks. and everythign around, but no visible signs of anyone coming or going from the tower. -- there appears to be at least 4 floors to the tower, with some sort of balcony up towards the top.
* kuran named the pigme 'george' and tries to force him into the tower.
* kuran pushes george through the doorway.
* the impact from george kciks up quite a bit of dust.
* as it settles we can see into the lab. there is a short set of stairs climbing up wards to the first floor.


* we enter the lab
* aleric holds up his dagger and makes it glow with light.
* inside the tower is stairs and a desk.
* ash goes and looks at the desk and sees a book or ledger. -- goods that have been purchased or services that were rendered, lose balance sheet.. there is another book that seems to be some sort of message book, short notes, jotted down, many pieces of paper may have been torn out and handed off to seomeone else.
* ash does an arcanda check on the symbols on the floor - NAT - looking at the design on the floor - nothing suggests its some kind of magical rune, doing something to the tower itself - i do notice more closely that there are a fair number of symbols fro mthe fayewilde. the symbol itself suggests -- kind from someone who is actively investigating faye wild or fayewild itself.
* aleric pages through the books on the table.
* the message book has multiple notes about securing boats -- chartering vessels off the coast.
* there are mentions of glass bottles.
* mention of equipment for swimming.
* hooks and rope, series of lenses, 
* belvin was really curious about the comings and goings of hte port or water in the bay/harbor.
* second floor, library
* aleric finds a journal.

Day 42 - picked up a faint ethereal energy signature from one of the tablets off the coast in the bay. It pulsed and thurmmed in time with the moon phases. Connection to the feywild cannot be ruled out.”

Day 57 - got my first look at one of the tablets. the runes etched on it - strange. Old language, forgotten by most, echoes of fey perhaps. Most consult ancient texts.

Day 68: Tablet showed a violent reaction to cold iron today. Same with previous tests involving Fey creatures. Must investigate further.

Day 74: Unsettling dreams since working with the tablet. Whispers of unknown voices, calls from a distant realm? Must tread carefully.

Day 81: Roberto might have been onto something. The spatial and temporal distortions near the tablets could indeed suggest a portal. But where does it lead?

Day 117: Roberto was wrong. We shouldn't move these tablets. Must prevent any further attempts. Too dangerous, too unpredictable.

Day 118: I’ve found the original position for this tablet; will scout tonight to see if we can get it there without the Saesha’sol stopping us.

* ash looks at the sheets of paper strewn about to see what people were writing about before the left.
* one of hte pieces of paper appears to be a letter being written to black staff tower -- a call to keep the tablets in haling cove and not try and relocate them. and not to send anyoen else to try and take them away -- retrieve them.
* the dragon wanted us to find tablets.

remembers something the mist dragon mentioned

“Go to Haling Cove and find the artifacts. The fate of the Cloakwood, the Sea of Swords, and perhaps even Faerun itself hangs in the balance. I would do this task myself, but fear I would draw far too much attention to things that are best left quiet.

“The presence of your Boggle suggests that the situation is worsening, and we can no longer simply watch."

* we look around the room at hte shelves.
* kuran looks over a set of bottles - they have strange materials in them, there are some acids
* potions of transfishgeration
* potions of water breathing
* ash takes a potion of each
* the third floor has a table and a door dividing the room. ash goes to open the door but it is locked.
* kuran comes up to the third floor without george - george lays unoncious to the desk.
* he tries to pick the lock - he disapears to the third floor.
* we enter the room, the atmosphere changes instantly, the room looks new, not dusty.
* the room has a more lived in fealing.
* the most striking feature is a grand piano in the corner.
* most of hte other furniture in the room is simple with magical para. on  them.
* ash looks about at the magical stuff on the furniture.
  * NAT in a drawer i find a similar drift globe, glass sphere, find an older wand that can be used as a focus, overwelciming strongest thing in the room, craziest fealing from the piano. -- or something near the piano.
* aleric goes over to the piano and casts identify on the piano, eyes sinilating, shining.
* aleric plays the piano but some of the keys do not eminate sound.
* aleric gets closer and investigates the keys that don't work properly. the keys themselves are workign but the strings do not vibrate properly.
* he relays to the group.
* lucy rolls her eyes, lifts her hands, and eldridge blasts the piano the blast hits the piano '8' damage, the force topples the piano to its side and it slams into the back wall.
* a huge thud on the inside of hte piano.
* ash goes over and reaches inside the piano to readch for the thing that fell.
* there is a large green stone tablet inside the piano.
* ash wraps it in a cloth and lays it on a table.
* aleric senses the power in the tablet is overwhelming. -- it bridges and touches the fabric of reality. it seems to be corsing with faye magics. this kind of tablet expects it to act like a stitch. used with other tablets to seal a rift.
* the order and spacing of the tablets is critical to maintain the organization of the planes.
* breakign down the tablet would be potent.
* dj3puty finds a loose floor board with a hastily drawn map of the edge of the coast line with 6 markings on it. mostly off the coast, but one in the woods.

9/5/2023 play date

* deputy takes the tablet.
* go up to the top floor
* well cared floor, no dust present.
* aleric goes over to the telescope to look through it without moving it.
* the large bronze telescope is pointed out to the beach, and the rift.
* might be matching up to a location on the map that was found.
* kuran joins us and inspects the contraption in the middle of the room.
* doesn't see anything
* aleric comes over and licks the geared mechanism in the room.
* labels on the gears say fayewild, material ,earth, fire, air, water, shadowfell.
* the mechanism doesnt look reputable to ash.
* d3puty studies the thing while we all rest, he notices that the mechanism seems to model the planes and check the alignment.
* kuran notices d3puties movement seems more fluid than normal, or has been. d3puty's face seems more expresive. 
* 




---

* kuran walks over the d3puty to see what is going on.
* 'you look like a fresh cup of coffee'
* d3puty looks down at himself. looks inward, and notices that he is more limber than he's used too. something feels more fluid.
* d3puty checks if moving from the contraption affects this, but it doesn't.
* kuran notices that a section d3puty's back has a soft green glow to it. kuran picks up a stick and prods d3puties back.
* kuran opens his pack and notices that the tablet has a soft glow to it as well.
* d3puty notes that the tablet might be causing it.
* d3puty is holding it out in front him.
* everyone else wakes up and d3puty relays the nights events. -- including the glow.
* another set of eyes pop out of the side of deputies leg and look around at the other people in the room, and then pops back in.
* 'thats new' thats not me' d3puty checks his leg.
* aleric attempts to check on d3puty but is still tired.
* d3puty looks down at his leg and determine that part of his leg has eyes, a tiny section of his own body has animated into another being that he can communicate with.
* ash becomes curious of what effect it would have on himself.
* lucy has a similar urget to the tablet. ash is nervous knowing this.
* ash wraps the tablet in a heavy curtain adn hands it back to d3puty.
* ash makes a second curtain cape and wraps it around d3puty to try and mask the glow





* we desend the tower and go outside.
* the pigme is awake but bound and towed by kuran.
* ash asks the captain when the last time someone was in there. -- she relays its been at least 20 years.
* we head down to the docks to try and charter a boat.
* ash goes to hte monger to see if they have any chulle repelent. the persons name is 'maxwell'
' i dont know of any chule repelent but as long as you arent using magic they wont bother you ' ... dont use magic fishing hooks, lines, etc.. no wind spells, get stuck out in the water -- they seem to pick up on magic pretty quick. they walk on the bottom, they dont swim on th surface. they can walk up on teh shore. thats about that.
* alaric thinks we should use the transfishguration potion.
* we gather on the docks.
* we gather on two boats
  * boat 1
    * ash
    * d3puty
    * lucy
  * boat 2
    * alaric
    * kuran 
    * pigme
* alaric gives everyone a potion of transfishguration.
* we notice that the rift on the beach is substantially smaller than the last time we saw it.
* aleric points us in the direction of the spot he saw through the telescope
* waves are not particularly strong.
* as we head to seaesh island we see it is lined with wooden spikes and garrisons.
* as we approach the island there appears to be a sand bar.
* everything seems calm on the surface, but when i look down into the water i see large claws, vaguely see some kidn of oversized crab creature that seems to be following our boat.
* i point this out to d3puty and lucy, but we all decide to continue on,
* there is a chule under the water following us.
* we approach a mossy obsidian outcropping
* alaric seems to think this may be for the tablets.
* d3puty wants  to try and swim past chule
* there is a section of the stone in the structure where there appears to be a tile missing.
* ash uses clock on the little guy and he runs back to the docks away from our boats. with haste.
* it runs away on the harbor floor with teh ctule running after it.

# Session 9/12
:
*d3puty is going to head into the water to slot the tablet into the shrine.
* lucy d3puty and kuran jump into the water.
* as the tablet hits the water it glows bright through the cloth and algea and growth starts growing around it, currents start kiking up and water starts to churn and swirl. pushing teh boats away.
* all the peeps in the water are starting to feel a warm fuzzy, almost electrical feeling.
* animal life on the seafloor is awakening, crabs and shrimp are going crazy.
* alaric looks down into the water and it seems there is some kind of bloom in the area, seen or unseen.
* tablet seems to be using the water as a conduit, fae energy is just bleeding out into a large area. farther than it would reach normally.
* d3puty aborts and heads back to the surface.
* lucy uses magic to convince a crab to surface.
* when everyone comes back to the surface they see alaric carassesing the pigme to try and calm it down. he felt bad it was stressed.
 * d3puty resurfaces and tries to hold the ta blet out of the water. the creatures subside when he does that.
* as water drips off the tablet it energizes the fish.
* lucy is swimming in the chummy water, made from the entrails of the crab that was killed.
* **ash gets +1 WIS, +1 nature -1 acrobatics**

* lucy and kuran are swimming down to the site wehere the tablet goes.
* they are looking for markings but arent seeing much
* ash splits ghostly
* alaric picks up the tablet to look closely. he can tell that the tablet has been charged with some very powerful fae and planer magics. the kind that you might use to try and reach across planes. has access to some of the raw fae energy from the fae wwild or the shadowfell. this probably was built this power ful because it is tgrying to hold the planes apart from each other.
* identify: guessing that some of the sheer strength of the artifact anyoen that comes into contact with it is likely to have a temporary effect, especially if they are connected with water or some other teams. sufficient time in close proximity to the tablet, prolonged exposure may cause permanent changes. the fae energies perm. alter the the creatures around it.
* the last bit, haziest bit: expecting that the sheer volume of share energy with a conduit like water is almost enchanting, or calls out to the creatures in the area.
* alaric touches the tablet, 
* ash parts the water with a choral staff left in the boat.
* the boat descends to the oean floor, and sits on the floor.
* aleric starts running with the tablet to the shrine.
* a flash of green light eminates from the tablet as aleric slots the tablet in
* a snap of sound rattles in the distance as its slotted in.
* when the water

* we go back to shore and from the distance it looks like the rift is gone.
* but beyond that but kuran thinks something is going on by the docks.
* over at the docks there is a little bit of outrite chaos going on, torches, yelling, multiple people running around, one of the boats there, the mast is toppled over, appears to be broken. the dock is sinking slightly
* one or two chules are on the docks, attacking hte people, enganged and raging.

* level up to 3
