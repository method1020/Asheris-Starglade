I am Asheris Starglade, a Wood Elf hailing from a secluded woodland community near Haling Cove, my families legacy is deeply intertwined with the [Sylvan Sentinels](#sylvan-sentinels), a revered group responsible for safeguarding the forest surrounding [Haling Cove](#haling-cove), the thriving city on the bay. However, despite my family's heritage, I have chosen a different path for myself.

Growing up in the woods, I developed a strong affinity for nature and a profound connection with the forest's creatures. As I reached adulthood, a sense of wanderlust and curiosity about the wider world drove me to embark on my own journey rather than following in the footsteps of my family. I sought to deepen my understanding of the diverse cultures and forge their own path as a Twilight Cleric, drawing upon the celestial gift they received in the hidden glade.

Despite not joining the ranks of the [Sylvan Sentinels](#sylvan-sentinels), I remain deeply committed to the protection of the forest and the harmony between the city and the natural world. I strive to use my divine powers to heal, guide, and bring balance wherever I go.

# Adventure

## Chapter 1 - Willdale and the Cloakwood
*Play Date: June 20, 2023*

### On the Road

*My entires for today are not complete as this page of the journal got wet in my travels. - Ash*
:
We received a letter from a courier with a request for us to find [Talia](#talia) about a job. Gold these days has been getting short. So we figured the short walk was worth while. Travels to [Willdale](#willdale) are usually uneventful.

### Town Center

Our arrival in [Willdale](#willdale) was marked with a sense of unfamiliarity and uncertainty. We were adrift in purpose, unsure of where to find [Talia](#talia) or where our next steps should lead us. In response, our party decided to split up, hoping to cover more ground and gather information. [Lucy](#lucy) and I ventured through the town, engaging with the locals. Lucy, ever so fervently, attempted to recruit more followers for The Fiend, her devotion unwavering.

<center>
<img src="_images/willdale.png" width="75%">
<figcaption><b>The Town of Willdale</b></figcaption>
</center>

As we meandered through the town, our journey eventually led us to the Inn - a hub of Willdale's daily life and stories. The Inn was bustling, a mosaic of people and conversations. In the midst of this lively atmosphere, something unexpected occurred. Lucy, with her uniquely deft hands and a knack for trouble, managed to rob the tavern owner. The details of how this transpired were a blur, a swift and sly act that even I could barely keep track of.

The situation escalated quickly, and before we could fully grasp the repercussions of Lucy's actions, we found ourselves fleeing towards the edge of town. The need for a hasty retreat was clear - staying would have only invited trouble and risked the entire party's safety. So, under the cloak of urgency and secrecy, we made our escape, the image of Willdale fading behind us as we moved swiftly into the embrace of the unknown.

## Chapter 2 - The Spider
*Play Date: June 27, 2023*

### Middle of the Night

I was awoken in the middle of the night from my resting state. I heard a noise from the darkness ahead but couldn't quite place it. The rest of my adventurers appeared to be sleeping, having rushed from town the evening before. The ash's from the nights fire barely glowing. 

Suddenly a sticky web pinned me to a tree, I couldn't move at all. I looked out into the darkness, even with my keen eyesight, I was unable to see what is trapping me, or who attacked us. While [D3PUTY](#d3puty) looks out into the distance I wake up [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise). Neither of them are able to see the monster either. We awaken the rest of the team.

I think in an attempt to bring light to the darkness, [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) lights a bolt of cloth on fire. Illuminating the area around us, but the foe remained cloaked in darkness. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) attempted to scare the monster with his *Hideous Laughter* but was unable to conjure the spell in his sleepy mental fog.

I am eventually able to break free from the sticky web after [Lucy](#lucy) ignites the tree I am trapped against on fire. But not before the team is struck with booming thunder from the skies ([Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) really needs to wake up!)

A giant armored spider finally makes it appearance by pouncing on [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) -- pinning him to the ground! I attempted to attack the beast. Conjuring up my [Guiding Bolt](#guiding-bolt) but am unable to work it. (I really need to practice more).

With this failure, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) pulls his longbow (from where, I have no idea), and fires against the best. It collapses, defeated.

<center><img src="_images/dead-spider.png" width="75%"></center>

### The Grove and Meeting Talia

With the morning sun starting to rise I heard footsteps coming from the distance. An Elf and Dwarf approach. The Elf introduced herself as [Talia](#talia). Her and her dwarven comrades bring us to their camp in the north-east of [Willdale](#willdale).

The camp is made up of a handful of wooden cabins scattered about a small field -- [The Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood) surrounding it. I did notice a familiar tower near the edge of camp. Though I can't quite place it.

[D3PUTY](#d3puty) has discovered what [Talia](#talia) may want us for: he discovered that [Talia](#talia) has been doing some extensive research into the Fey of the [Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood).

We met [Talia](#talia) outside. She informed us we have been hired to determine why the [Brownies](#the-brownies) have been attacking the towns folk and loggers.

[D3PUTY](#d3puty) pulled from his knowledge-base that this is very unusual behavior for [Brownies](#the-brownies), they are typically "insisted", simple minded, and there are for scarier things in [The Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood) than dwarves.
: 
[Talia](#talia) has provided us direction, and we set out.

---

## Chapter 3 - The Grove

*Play Date: July 11, 2023*

### Discovering the Cloakwood

We embarked on a path known to be tread by the Brownies in and through the [Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood), diminutive creatures standing no taller than four feet. We moved through the forest, guided by the gaps in the trees, where the sunlight streamed through to light our way.

My mind drifted back to old stories and knowledge: the Brownies, typically solitary creatures, with no central leadership to speak of. They set up camps in various locations, drawn to the beauty of the world and the promise of ample sustenance. They often steer clear of humanoids, choosing to dwell in peace. Tales speak of Sylvans driven out of their towers - a disturbing anecdote of the times we live in. Their language is a mixture of Sylvan, Halfling, and at times, Common. 

[Kuran](#kuran-ardois) attempted to get a better view of our surroundings by scaling a towering tree but was unable to spot anything significant.

As the forest path narrowed, we made a strategic decision to split up - [D3PUTY](#d3puty) and [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) ventured east, while [Kuran](#kuran-ardois) and I headed south. The path underfoot was well-trodden and quiet, the silence only punctuated by the sounds of wildlife in the distance.

Eventually, those who headed east found themselves in a clearing, a vast opening in the otherwise dense woodland. I look forward to reuniting with them soon and sharing what we have discovered in our respective journeys.

### The Tent

> **Account of Aleric, D3PUTY, and Kuran**
>
> The group had found themselves in a serene setting—a small pond adjacent to a towering boulder. Kuran had taken the initiative to explore the area in search of signs of the elusive Brownies, while Aleric and D3PUTY observed with anticipation. The tranquil atmosphere and the air of mystery that surrounded the scene piqued his curiosity.

As I stealthily made my way through the eastern forest, I skillfully maneuvered around the worn and disheveled camp in the distance. My goal was clear: reach the trail that led northward to meet up with [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise), and [D3PUTY](#d3puty). I knew the importance of maintaining a safe distance from the tent, so I focused on staying hidden as I moved through the undergrowth.

Every step I took was deliberate, ensuring I made no unnecessary noise that could give away my presence. The forest seemed to offer its guidance, revealing hidden paths that led me closer to my companions. I remained vigilant, scanning my surroundings for any signs of danger or potential obstacles.

Navigating through the dense foliage, I followed the concealed trail with determination. I carefully evaded any traces of detection, my instincts guiding me towards the rendezvous point. Finally, I emerged from the forest, relieved to see the familiar faces of [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise), and [D3PUTY](#d3puty) waiting for me.

With a sense of accomplishment, I explained my decision to bypass the worn and disheveled camp, focusing instead on our shared journey and the mysteries that awaited us. 

### Fudh and Goim

We headed south towards the tent and [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) and I skillfully approached the worn and disheveled tent, our curiosity pushed us to investigate further. [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) quietly peeked inside, revealing a surprising scene of Brownies engrossed in sticks and dice games. Among them, two stood out—one with a brown hat and the other with a distinctive red hat.

To our astonishment, the Brownie with the red hat noticed Kuran's presence and eagerly divulged details about their camp. He mentioned that their leader, known as [Grum](#grum), was waiting for us. Intrigued, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) joined our conversation, observing that the Brownie with the red hat seemed a little peculiar, smirking and hinting at the mysterious nature of meeting Grum.

They introduce themselves as [Fudh](#fudh) and [Goim](#goim).

However, it was [the Brownie](#the-brownies) wearing the brown hat who seized the opportunity. He cunningly offered to exchange our gold for a chance to meet Grum and be guided to their camp. With a slight hesitation, we relinquished the gold, intrigued by the prospect of discovering more about these enigmatic Brownies and their elusive leader.

### To the Camp

As [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) and [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) trailed the Brownies towards their camp, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) quietly followed Kuran's lead, while I stealthily sneaked alongside, remaining unnoticed by the rest of the party. Little did we know that [Grum](#grum), the leader of the Brownies, would turn out to be an unusually large and fat Boggle, a rare sight given their usual small stature.

Seizing the opportunity, I crept up behind [Grum](#grum) and the Brownies in their camp, equipped with sleeping mushroom spores harvested from the mushrooms growing on my shoulders. With a swift application, I put three of the Brownies to sleep, leaving the remaining ones trembling in fear as they fled. The group, sensing an advantage, launched an attack on Grum.

I took the initiative and employed a necrotic mushroom, inflicting severe damage akin to an acid burn onto Grum's shoulder. Our combined efforts proved successful as we fought valiantly, taking on the formidable Boggle. The encounter was intense and full of surprises, as our party faced a foe larger and more dangerous than expected.

<center><img src="_images/boggle_grum.jpg" width="75%"></center>

In the midst of the chaotic battle, [Aleric's](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) attempt to cast hideous laughter on [Grum](#grum) backfires, leaving him laughing uncontrollably. [Kuran's](#kuran) attack misses its mark, and [Grum](#grum), displaying an unexpected ability, becomes shiny and oily, reappearing on the other side of the field. [D3PUTY's](#d3puty) attempt with the longbow also fails, as does my own with the crossbow.

Determined to subdue [Grum](#grum), [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) fiercely strikes him while he tries to escape. [Grum](#grum), displaying his teleportation ability, surprises us by suddenly appearing behind me. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), moving with surprising swiftness, pommels Grum with a dagger, rendering him unconscious.

As I survey the remaining Brownies, [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) shouts, "Are you not amused?" After [Kuran's](#kuran) taunting words echo through the clearing, the remaining Brownies are visibly frightened. The unexpected display of power from our group and the defeat of their leader, Grum, have left them no choice but to scatter in all directions. Their tiny figures disappear into the foliage, escaping into the safety of the forest.

As the dust settles, the once lively camp now lies in silence, only the rustling of leaves and the occasional hoot of an owl filling the air. We gather ourselves, ensuring that [Grum](#grum) is securely fastened to [D3PUTY's](#d3puty) back. Despite the intensity of the battle, a sense of relief washes over us. We've achieved our goal, but our journey is far from over.

With a collective understanding, we decide to make our way back, carrying Grum with us. The forest slowly envelopes us once more as we walk through the undergrowth, retracing our steps to return to the place where it all began.

### Night Settles In

Settled within the confines of [Grum](#grum)'s dim-lit camp, I'm kept awake by the hum of activity around me. [Lucy](#lucy) saunters in, eliciting laughter and amusement from the group as she recounts her latest adventure - an audacious feat involving selling her pilfered trousers from her days in Willdale. Her knack for light-hearted trouble seems to have an almost magical way of lifting our spirits (well, for most of us at least).

Having made the decision to overnight in [Grum](#grum)'s thatched shelter, I can hear [D3PUTY](#d3puty) and [Lucy](#lucy) engaged in earnest conversation just beyond the entrance. Their words - questions of reality and meaning - drift in and out of my hearing.

From my place of quiet observation, I watch as [D3PUTY](#d3puty) scrutinizes [Grum](#grum) with a hardened gaze. He senses a potent, malevolent magic surrounding [Grum](#grum), a force that carries echoes of the Feywild or perhaps the Shadowfell. The air seems to thicken with intrigue and uncertainty as [Grum](#grum) holds us within his enigmatic grip.

<center><img src="_images/out-campfire.jpg" width="75%"></center>

[Lucy](#lucy), guided by her instinctual acumen for the arcane, tries to discern the nature of [Grum](#grum)'s divine patron. She appears to determine that [Grum](#grum) is a being displaced from another plane, deepening the shroud of mystery that wraps around this curious Boggle.

As the hours stretch on, I remain ever-watchful, my senses attuned to the sounds and movements that fill the night. The campfire casts dancing shadows across the faces of my companions, its crackling chorus a soothing lullaby against the backdrop of hushed voices. In my state of restful alertness, I bear witness to the stories spun, the revelations uncovered, and the riddles posed - each deepening the complexity of our enthralling journey.

## Chapter 4 - Returning to Willdale

*Play Date: July 18, 2023*

### Leaving the Brownie Camp

We, as a group, had been preparing to depart from the camp when our path crossed with that of a unique creature, a Brownie named [Alarin](#alarin), donned in an eye-catching purple hat. She was returning from her ventures in the forest, her wary eyes telling stories untold.

Her fear was tangible in the cool air, an emotion I aimed to assuage temporarily using the soporific spores of my magical shoulder mushrooms, their mystical properties sending her into a deep slumber. In her vulnerable state, [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) conducted an intrusive yet necessary search, a necessity that never ceases to unsettle me.

Upon awakening, [Alarin](#alarin) was met with the calming demeanor of [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), his soothing words breaking through her initial trepidation. In the midst of this, [Lucy](#lucy), seizing an opportunity with an impish grin, absconded with Alarin's purple hat.

[Alarin](#alarin)'s attempts at escaping bore no fruit, her fear driving her actions. She revealed tales of a certain Grum, a creature who ruled over the Brownies through fear. Lucy, relentless in her pursuit of knowledge, pressed Alarin for more information. To underscore our intent, I channeled my Thaumaturgy, amplifying Lucy's voice until it echoed ominously throughout the quiet forest. Alarin relented, marking on our map of the Cloakwood forest where others of her kind could be found.

With our newly acquired knowledge, we made the collective decision to return to the lumber camp, hopeful to find Talia. As I sit here under the canopy of twilight, our recent encounters weigh on my mind. The balance of our world remains delicate, yet I am hopeful. Standing united with my companions, I trust that we can guide those burdened by fear towards the dawn's light. 

### Back at the Lumber Camp

We returned to the lumber camp in [Willdale](#willdale) and reunited with [Talia](#talia). As we gathered around her cabin, I observed the curious sight of [Grum](#grum), the boggle, perched on [D3PUTY](#d3puty)'s back. The encounter with the boggle had left us with many questions, and we eagerly reported to [Talia](#talia) about the dark fey magic we had encountered surrounding [Grum](#grum).

[Talia](#talia) took a keen interest in [Grum](#grum) and inspected him closely. I couldn't help but notice the oozing and deteriorating state of [Grum](#grum)'s arm, a result of the necrotic damage I had inflicted during our intense battle with him. [Talia](#talia)'s initial impulse was to shoot and kill [Grum](#grum), but [D3PUTY](#d3puty) intervened, preventing her from taking drastic action.

In an unexpected turn of events, [Grum](#grum) suddenly blinked or teleported away while [Lucy](#lucy) tried to charm him for more information about his origin. [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) attempted to shoot him with his bow, but the arrow missed its mark.

Despite the chaotic encounter, [Talia](#talia) expressed her gratitude, rewarding us for successfully stopping [Grum](#grum). She seemed pleased that we had managed to do so without harming the Brownies in the process.

[Talia](#talia) now seeks to introduce us to her master, [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr). Intrigued by the opportunity, we follow [Talia](#talia) as she leads us to a point on the coast, where a small cabin and pier await. The mysteries of this journey continue to unfold, and I am eager to see what awaits us in the presence of [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) and the adventures that lie ahead.

### Sæsephyr

Our journey led us to the pier, where [Talia](#talia) guided us to meet [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr). As we approached, a heavy air filled the surroundings, as if foretelling an impending storm.

Then, from the depths of the water, a mesmerizing sight appeared—a scaly and shimmery figure materialized, revealing an enormous dragon—an ancient mist dragon. Its presence was awe-inspiring, and although I had heard stories of such beings in these lands, I had never laid eyes on one before.

<center><img src="_images/saesephyr.jpg" width="75%"></center>

The dragon, whom [Talia](#talia) addressed as [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr), seemed to have some familiarity with me, though I couldn't quite place it. Tales of an ancient mist dragon named [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) had circulated, and I now found myself standing before this enigmatic creature.

Aleric's unease was evident, and Kuran shared the same sentiments. Their caution was well-founded in the presence of such an imposing being.

[Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) spoke with wisdom and urgency, revealing a long-forgotten tale of two wizards seeking ancient magical artifacts near the town of Haling Cove. The fate of these artifacts and the surrounding realms rested on their decisions. The demise of the wizards—Archmage [Roberto](#roberto) and the ambitious [Belven](#belvin)—remained shrouded in mystery, with the ominous presence of The [Sæsha'sol](#the-sæshasol) (The Sea Gloom) casting shadows over their fate.

The dragon entrusted us with a crucial task—to journey to Haling Cove and uncover the lost artifacts. A daunting responsibility, one that [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) himself refrained from taking due to the attention it might draw.

As a sign of his trust, [Sæsephyr](#sæsephyr) offered us magical tools from the cabin by the pier, essential for our upcoming quest.

> “Travelers, I have asked Talia to seek you out, because I believe you have the best chance to succeed. Long ago, two wizards sought out ancient magical artifacts, near the town of [Haling Cove](#haling-cove-1). Archmage [Roberto](#roberto) believed he could unravel their secrets and took with him a delegation to take the artifacts somewhere they could be kept safe and studied, whereas the younger, more ambitious Wizard [Belven](#belvin) wanted to study them for himself, and knew as soon as they were in Roberto’s vaults they’d be out of his reach.
> 
> “As Roberto prepared to take an artifact from the oceans, he was found murdered on the docks. Some suspected Belven, but the town of Haling Cove sided with Belven - they found him charming, and he planned to retrieve the tablet for himself.
> 
> A few months later, Belven was also found dead, his back full of tiny spears - likely the work of the [The Sæsha'sol](#the-sæshasol) (The Sea Gloom). It’s uncertain whether he found and retrieved any of the artifacts or not.
> 
> Go to Haling Cove and find the artifacts. The fate of [the Cloakwood](#the-cloakwood-1), the [Sea of Swords](#sea-of-swords), and perhaps even Faerun itself hangs in the balance. I would do this task myself, but fear I would draw far too much attention to things that are best left quiet.
> 
> The presence of your Boggle suggests that the situation is worsening, and we can no longer simply watch.

Our meeting with [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr) bore important counsel - the Sea of Swords is treacherous and best avoided, we were advised to stick to land routes. Retrieving the artifacts ourselves was deemed the prudent choice, for if [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr) were to attempt, it might draw an undesirable amount of attention. However, [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr)'s promise of assistance should we need and call for it was reassuring.

Even as we discussed our plans, [Lucy](#lucy) showed her carefree spirit, leaping into the water from the pier, swimming lazily, revelling in the moment. Meanwhile, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) sought to understand the relationship between Talia and [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr), learning that Talia served as [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr)'s emissary in dealing with others.

The mention of Haling Cove stirred my memory - a story from my childhood about two wizards, Belvin and Roberto. As a child, I had lived through their time, their tales now a part of history and lore.

Our journey brought us past a fascinating fountain near the pier as we made our way to the cabin for supplies. [D3PUTY](#d3puty) examined the fountain, noticing runes inscribed along its side. Despite [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver)'s assistance, the nature of the runes eluded us, though we recognized the fountain as a potential source of mana.

In a playful jest, [Lucy](#lucy) dared us to drink the water, and before [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) could even respond, Talia scooped up a handful of the fountain's water and drank, a demonstration of faith in the unknown.

## Chapter 5 - To Haling Cove

*Play Date: July 25, 2023*

### Headed Home

>*Looking back, my time spent in Haling Cove floods my mind with vibrant recollections. The idyllic bay city, draped in a harmony of nature and civilization, always felt like a second home. The Sylvan Sentinels, my family, maintained a vigil over the encompassing forest, ensuring the city's tranquility. As a child, I would often lose myself in the labyrinth of marketplaces, drawn to the symphony of bustling life, the scent of spices, and the sight of numerous wares from far-off lands. I remember the wizards, Belvin and Roberto, their stories of magic and wonder resonating deep within me. Despite not being a part of the Sentinels myself, Haling Cove still shaped me, its influence running as deep as the roots of the forest that guards it.*

### Centaurs

We resolved to enter Haling Cove under the cover of night, a decision accompanied by a shroud of uncertainty. Our journey began on a well-trodden path between [Willdale](#willdale) and [Haling Cove](#haling-cove), under the vast, twinkling canvas of the evening sky.

As we traveled, the rustling sounds of approach reached our ears. Drawing on my elven instincts, I melted into the shadows of the trees flanking our path. To our surprise, we were greeted by the sight of a pair of centaurs moving gracefully down the road. [Lucy](#lucy), ever the impulsive one, emerged in front of the majestic creatures, creating a momentary standstill.

[D3PUTY](#d3puty), in his typical observant manner, whispered to us that these centaurs, bathed in an ethereal bioluminescent glow, were likely members of the [Shadowglow Clan](#shadowglow-clan), and generally friendly. As Lucy attempted to explain our connection with [Sæsephyr](#Sæsephyr) the dragon, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) swiftly intervened, spinning a tale that Sæsephyr was merely a moniker, not an actual dragon. Astonishingly, the centaurs bought into the lie.

Providing us with invaluable information, they confirmed the route to Haling Cove should be unobstructed. However, they warned us to steer clear of the beaches, citing unusual creatures lurking along the coast. Their words, laced with caution, added an edge to my already wary spirits.

Deciding to err on the side of caution, we trailed the centaurs from a safe distance until the silhouette of Haling Cove began to take shape through the darkened trees. 

### Familiar Woods

We arrived at the outskirts of Haling Cove as the sun began to surrender to the encroaching darkness. Our path led us to a somber clearing that stirred a chilling memory from my childhood. I found myself drawn to it, my heart sinking as the realization of what lay beneath the surface dawned on me. 

This was a mass grave, a grim testament to the days when a flood of sick refugees sought sanctuary within Haling Cove's walls, only to be denied entry. The memory of the refugees' fate, dying en masse virtually overnight, still bore heavy on my heart. They were buried here, far from the safety and warmth of their homes, their lives reduced to untended mounds of earth. 

[D3PUTY](#d3puty) tried to dredge up any memories of Haling Cove, but to no avail. The city, it seemed, was buried under layers of forgotten memories, much like the refugees under the soil.

Peering into the gathering dusk, I sought signs of the [Sylvan Sentinels](#sylvan-sentinels) in the treeline, but the forest stood silent and still. However, the path stretching towards the right was a familiar sight. I remembered it being a bustling route leading to the town, often teeming with foot traffic. 

To the left lay another path, one that diverged towards an old mining camp. The choice ahead of us was clear - venture into the heart of Haling Cove or explore the forgotten remnants of the mining camp. 

### Short Rest in the Abandoned Mining Camp

Having decided to rest for the night, we found a suitable spot in an abandoned camp close by. While we settled, [Lucy](#lucy) took it upon herself to scout the area, perusing the remnants of the camp's past life. She returned with an assortment of discarded objects - a pair of antlers, some skins - tangible traces of those who had once inhabited these tents.

To our north, a dormant mine sprawled out, its entrance yawning open like a mouth in the earth. Rusting, forgotten equipment hinted at its past hustle and bustle. [D3PUTY](#d3puty), meanwhile, peered into the forests' shadows, seemingly drawn in by an inexplicable presence. He was confident he sensed the Fae and even speculated about spotting a Sylvan tower amid the foliage. 

[Lucy](#lucy) then brandished the map we'd received from the Brownies. According to her interpretation, part of the map suggested a section of the nearby forest. It also marked a Brownie settlement within what seemed to be a manageable distance from our current location.

As we hunkered down for the night, the thought of what the new dawn would bring hung heavily in the air.

### Haling Cliffs

After a brief respite, our party decided to push on towards the town. We chose to stick to the cover of the woods for our approach, all except [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) who preferred to follow the road. [D3PUTY](#d3puty) and I successfully scaled the cliff-side near the mine's opening, though [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) and [Lucy](#lucy) weren't as fortunate, their attempts ending in a tumble. As [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) set off on his own, he employed [Lucy](#lucy)'s drift orb to light his way, prompting [Lucy](#lucy) to chase after him and join him on the road.

Meanwhile, I tied a rope around [D3PUTY](#d3puty) and helped [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) up the cliff. Once reunited, we pressed on, under the cloak of the woods. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), now accompanied by [Lucy](#lucy), continued along the road, peering into the darkness of the forest but seeing little.

While moving through the heavy woods, [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) managed to discern the outline of a heavily overgrown guard tower in the forest. The tower, nearly consumed by creeping vines and interlacing branches, appeared to have several rooms formed within and around it, their windows glowing faintly with light.

<center><img src="_images/sylvan-tower.webp" width="75%">
<figcaption><b>Sylvan Tower</b></figcaption>
</center>

Recognizing this as an old Sylvan sentinel tower, I approached cautiously, finding evidence of Brownie inhabitants. Choosing to introduce ourselves as friends of [Fudh](#fudh) and [Goim](#goim) (an unabashed falsehood), we managed to gain a skeptical audience with the Brownie woman who answered the door.

In exchange for a modest offering of gold, we were served small cups of frothy liquid by a pair of Brownies, and our hostess stoked the fire in a welcoming gesture, throwing a burning log into the fireplace.

### Strangers in Haling Cove

As dusk cloaks the surrounding in a dim veil, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) and [Lucy](#lucy) part ways with us, opting for the defined trail leading to the town instead of scaling the cliffs with the rest of us. Aleric, seemingly engrossed in his own soliloquy, doesn’t notice when Lucy, with her knack for stealth, dissipates into the shadows behind him. He merely shrugs and continues his self-absorbed discourse.

Upon nearing the town, the sounds of his monologue are intersected by a voice echoing through the nightly stillness, originating from the outskirts of the town. The silhouette of a woman materializes, a hand on her hilt, her voice a blend of caution and intrigue. She is vigilant, questioning Aleric’s lone nocturnal roam. Aleric, weaving a tapestry of partial truths, tries to sway her suspicions but the strands of his story don’t interlace convincingly. He mentions Lucy’s sudden departure, but the woman’s eyes, bathed in skepticism, probe deeper. She is resolute, calling his bluff yet again. Eventually, Aleric peels off layers of deception, revealing partial truths about our party, careful not to divulge the core of our venture. The tense grip around her hilt loosens, a semblance of trust dawning in her demeanor. She introduces herself as Corrine, the sheriff of the town, whose authority seems to be wavering in these times. Corrine, a human appearing in her mid-30s, bears a roughened visage with a mohawk and an eye patch cloaking her right eye. Despite her badge and rugged appearance, she doesn’t seem fully armored.

The scene transitions back to [Ash](#ash), [D3PUTY](#d3puty), and [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise). Our inquiries about Belvin and Roberto find echoes in the Brownies’ tales. It appears they might have crossed paths with these individuals. However, the Brownies admit to avoiding the town, preferring the unseen paths when necessity drives them there. We leave the Brownies, our pockets lighter but our hearts warmed by their hospitality, and make our way to the town, hoping to reunite with Aleric and Lucy. 

Ash’s memory paints images of an inn/pub nestled amongst the downtown shops, a probable refuge for our separated companions. Our paths converge again in the town, the familiar faces of our comrades blending with the tapestry of the inn’s patrons—a handful of humans, a dwarf, and a half-elf, immersed in their own worlds. Our requests for rooms are met with nods from the barkeep, and we settle in, our minds a whirlpool of thoughts and plans.

## Chapter 6 - The Nightwatch

*Play Date: August 1, 2023*

### The Inn, Shadows of Disfavor 

The warmth of the Honeywell Tavern welcomed us. [Matilda](#matilda): was busy behind the counter, skillfully pouring mugs of Honeywell mead and arranging plates of the most delectable dishes. I've heard stories of their famous honeyed pear tart, and it did not disappoint.

While my palate indulged in rich flavors, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver): seemed magnetically drawn to the fiery essence of hot spices, with a peculiar inclination for fried seaweed crisps. Matilda: was all too happy to cater to this adventurous craving.

In a lull, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver): engaged the locals, unraveling stories and legends. My own attention was caught by a bulletin board. Among the various postings, a wanted poster with an unrecognizable centaur-like figure piqued my interest. What truly caught my eye, however, was the dominating Night Watch recruitment note, so strategically placed that it obscured an older notice about the sheriff.

As I pieced together the snippets of town news, [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) beckoned me over, rambling something about his insatiable thirst for spice. I decided to gift (or possibly a test) of one of my lesser spicy shoulder sprouts. The little thing sent him crashing to the floor! Clearly, we had underestimated its potency. *The [Pyroshroom Blazehole](#pyroshroom-blazecap) is not to be trifled with.*

In the midst of the commotion, Aleric: had gained some information about the [Nightwatch](#the-nightwatch). Pointed in the direction of two imposing figures, one particularly bearded, he approached with that characteristic 'non-threatening old man' demeanor. Their interaction was... memorable. "Magic folk don't make good guards," the bearded one mused aloud. Wanting to make a point, a quick thaumaturgy spell from me didn't go unnoticed, and instead of being impressed, the men - from the Nightwatch, it turns out - were quite irritated. Before we knew it, we were summoned to meet with the Nightwatch.
:
Matilda: later revealed that these men were [Commander Roy Medeza](#commander-roy-medeza) and [Terry Thrampton](#terry-thrampton). The name Thrampton... it jogged my memory. The Thramptons were integral to Haling Cove's history. I remembered tales of Peter Thrampton's disappearance, intertwined with matrimonial alliances and familial legacies. And, as I pondered, I recalled the somber echoes of the Quiet Year, a significant event from some 20-25 years ago. It was during my time here, and its shadow still lingers in the town's psyche.

### A Night to NOT Remember

The late-night shroud of Haling Cove's docks seemed like the perfect cloak for my quest for information. Under the cover of darkness, the docks whispered with the secrets of the sea, secrets I hoped to uncover. However, the night had other, less favorable plans for me.

Just as the moon reached its zenith, casting eerie shadows over the creaking docks, the sound of heavy, methodical steps shattered the nocturnal peace. The Nightwatch, ever vigilant, emerged like specters from the darkness. My attempts to dissolve into the night's embrace were futile against their watchful eyes.

Questions came like arrows in the night, sharp and unyielding. My words, carefully chosen, seemed to dissipate into the cold air, unheard, unbelieved. It didn't take long before I found myself ensnared, a helpless quarry in their determined grasp.

The journey from the docks to the confinements of the Nightwatch jail blurred into a procession of shadows and dim lanterns. Here, in this cell, with the first light of dawn creeping through the small, barred window, I record these events. The walls around me are steeped in the silence of the early hours, a silence that bears the weight of uncertainty and unease.

For now, patience must be my ally. 

## Chapter 7 - The Rift

*Play Date: August 8, 2023*

### Recovering Ash

This morning, a palpable sense of unease hung over us as the majority of the adventurers awoke to find me missing. My absence was like a void, a silent alarm that something was amiss. [D3PUTY](#d3puty) descended the stairs to find [Matilda](#matilda) and another man behind the counter. Matilda suspected the [Nightwatch](#the-nightwatch) had taken Ash.

[D3PUTY](#d3puty), [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise), and [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver) promptly decided to venture to the docks in search of Ash. The fishmonger shops were closed, but men were already working the docks in the early light. D3PUTY scoured the area for signs of Ash, eventually discovering traces of a struggle and drag marks leading to a building adorned with the Nightwatch insignia.

Kuran stealthily circled the building, peering through a window. Inside, he could see three officers and a cell in the corner — Ash was inside. Using a magic Sea Shell, Ash explained his ordeal: he was ambushed by the Nightwatch near the docks, bagged, dragged, and incarcerated.

D3PUTY and Aleric entered the building while Kuran remained outside, scouting for alternate entries. Inside, Aleric recognized [Commander Medeza](#commander-roy-medeza), but D3PUTY didn't recognize the other two officers. When Medeza informed us we were free to go, D3PUTY played along, fabricating a story about our historical mission in town.

A man with the top hat, dressed in tattered finery, scrutinized D3PUTY and questioned Aleric about his origins. Aleric's quip about mistaking D3PUTY for a trash can only added to the tension. The conversation shifted to a trader named Jerry and a stolen cart, leading to more awkward exchanges and fabricated stories from our side.

Ash, still in the cell, tried to contact Kuran but only received a garbled response. Aleric, probing Medeza about the town's safety, learned of a 'gateway to hell' near the beach, a place spawning creatures that the Nightwatch's wall now keeps at bay.

With a glance between Aleric and D3PUTY, it was clear we had gathered all the information we needed. The Nightwatch didn't hinder our departure, allowing us to leave without further confrontation. As we left, the weight of the morning's revelations pressed heavily upon us, the town's hidden dangers and Ash's ordeal painting a troubling picture of what lay ahead.

### Outside the Walls

Outside the Nightwatch headquarters, the morning's revelations still churned in my mind, but I felt a renewed determination to glean more information from the docks. Nearing the dockmaster's station, I noticed a man, a figure marked by life at sea – one hand missing, his face adorned with smelly white stubble, and a chunk of cigar wedged firmly between his lips. His grayish-blue sweater seemed to envelop him like a second skin. Surprisingly, he offered us a job as dockhands around noon.

As we walked towards the beach, a well-kept residence caught my eye. The Thrampton family estate, unmistakable with its lush greenery and whitewashed walls, emanated sounds of merriment and the fragrance of herbs. A stark reminder of the town's intricate history.

Reaching the beach, we were confronted by a mesmerizing anomaly – a shimmering, iridescent crack in reality, a gateway to hell as described by Commander Medeza. It quivered, pulsating with life, casting prismatic colors across the sand. This rift, sprawling some 20-30 feet in length and 5 feet across at its widest, seemed to defy the very essence of our world.

I was about to test its reality with a thrown rock, but Aleric's caution stayed my hand. We observed a constructed wall across the beach entrance, mirroring the height of the surrounding cliffs – a barrier against unknown dangers.

[Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver)'s uneasy feeling, his sense of being watched, was palpable. He whispered a foreboding warning – we were not alone. His instincts hinted at unseen watchers, possibly from the sea or even the rift itself.

Drawn to the water's edge, my curiosity piqued by the unknown depths, I discovered a spear, partially concealed beneath the waves. It was a broken weapon, seemingly more suited for combat than fishing, possibly belonging to the rumored coastal pygmies.

This discovery sent a chill down my spine, as I recalled tales of [Belvin](#belvin), who met his end by similar tiny spears. In a moment of distraction, I found a cool rock and, driven by an inexplicable urge, aimed to throw it into the rift. Suddenly, a dart whizzed past, embedding itself into the sand. Turning sharply, I caught sight of someone's head just above the water, a blowgun in hand.

The realization struck – the danger wasn't just in the legends or the unseen depths of the rift. It was real, tangible, and alarmingly close.

## Chapter 8 - The Chuul

*Play Date: August 18, 2023*

### Sea Gloom Appear

The shores of [Haling Cove](#haling-cove) revealed their hidden and dangerous inhabitants – the [Sea Gloom](#the-sæshasol). Emerging from the water with their bluish skin and shadowy markings, they blended seamlessly with the sea, making them nearly invisible until they were almost upon us.

Suddenly, a flurry of darts hissed through the air. One narrowly missed [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), another was aimed at [D3PUTY](#d3puty). D3PUTY recognized these assailants as the Sæsha'sol, or Sea Gloom, known to the townsfolk as "Pygmies." These creatures, residing on an island south of the city, have always been shrouded in hostile mystery, historically known for their attacks on townsfolk.

In the heat of the moment, D3PUTY skillfully cast his net, ensnaring one of the Sea Gloom. Aleric responded with a spell of Hideous Laughter, briefly disarming the attackers with uncontrollable mirth. The Sea Gloom, however, quickly regained their composure and lunged at D3PUTY with their spears, only to be thwarted by his sturdy armor.

[Kuran](#kuran-ardoise) leaped into action, rapier in hand, slicing into one of the Sea Gloom with precision. A quick follow-up with his dagger sent the creature slumping lifelessly into the water. Meanwhile, [Lucy](#lucy) unleashed an Eldritch Blast, obliterating another assailant. From the corner of her eye, she noticed something unsettling in the water – fish chum and a trail of bubbles rising to the surface.

In response, I conjured a guiding bolt, striking another Sea Gloom squarely, causing it to fall into the churning waters. Simultaneously, I cast a shield of faith around Kuran, enveloping him in a protective light.

But our troubles were far from over. One of the Sea Gloom managed to hit me with a short bow, the arrow piercing through my clothing and drawing blood. As it attempted to flee, D3PUTY swung his sword in a valiant effort to stop it but missed. The creature then took out a long shell, blowing into it to produce a piercing whistle.

Reacting swiftly, D3PUTY pulled Kuran and Aleric out of the water. The Sea Gloom tried to strike again, but D3PUTY's counterattack was swift and fatal, ending the creature's threat as it slumped into the water. Aleric, utilizing his spell once more, incapacitated another Sea Gloom, leaving it thrashing helplessly in the waves.

The ensnared Sea Gloom, still trapped in D3PUTY's net, began to chant "chuul, chuul, chuul" – a word unfamiliar yet filled with ominous portent. The situation was escalating, the waters around us boiling with unseen dangers. The encounter with the Sea Gloom was far from a mere skirmish – it was a harbinger of deeper, darker conflicts lurking beneath the waves of Haling Cove.

### From the Depths

Chaos erupted on the shores as a monstrous claw, resembling that of a colossal crab or lobster, broke through the water's surface. [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), with a quick arcana check, identified the creature as a [Chuul](#chuul) - a gigantic, mythical crustacean known for its ferocity.

[Kuran](#kuran-ardoise), quick to react, loosed an arrow at the ensnared Sea Gloom, but his shot veered off target. Lucy, with unwavering focus, conjured another Eldritch Blast, aiming it squarely at the Chuul's claw. In response to the escalating threat, I hastily assembled a fairy ring of interwoven sticks, summoning a dome of protective twilight sanctuary around us.

<center><img src="_images/ring-of-sticks.webp" width="75%">
<figcaption><b>Conjuring the Twighlight Sanctuary</b></figcaption>
</center>

The Chuul, undeterred, advanced with terrifying ease through the water towards Aleric. With a swift and brutal assault, it struck him with its massive claws, leaving him unconscious and submerged in the water. In a desperate attempt to intervene, [D3PUTY](#d3puty) pointed his bow at the ensnared Sea Gloom, demanding it to call off the Chuul. The Sea Gloom, defiant and unyielding, egged on the Chuul with chants. D3PUTY, unfazed, aimed for the Chuul's eye and let loose an arrow, striking true.

[Kuran](#kuran-ardoise), undeterred by the creature's formidable armor, launched an attack but failed to inflict any damage. In a frantic effort to assist Aleric, he accidentally pushed Aleric's face into the water, exacerbating the situation. Meanwhile, the previously ensnared Sea Gloom broke free from the net, launching a fireball at D3PUTY that crashed onto the beach, failing to hit its target.

[Lucy](#lucy), remembering her arsenal of magical items, swam towards the Chuul, clumsily dog-paddling. I rushed to Aleric's aid, placing a white and indigo mushroom (an [Amanita Lifeshroud](#amanita-lifeshroud)) in his mouth to stabilize him. D3PUTY continued to focus on the Chuul, searching for vulnerabilities in its armor.

As a dense fog began to emanate from the hands of the tide-caller Sea Gloom, wrapping the battlefield in a cold mist, Kuran donned the manta cloak and submerged himself in the waters. Lucy, wielding the driftwood trident, successfully dominated the Chuul, commanding it to attack the tide-caller.

I attempted to distract the Chuul with a mating call, but it seemed to have no effect. The Chuul, under Lucy's command, brutally attacked the tide-caller, slamming it into the seafloor.

Our skirmish on the beach drew attention from the stone towers along the wall. A guard, missing a hand and sporting a claw in its place, waved down at us from his vantage point. It seemed our encounter had not gone unnoticed, and the eyes of [Haling Cove](#haling-cove) were now firmly upon us.

## Chapter 9 - Belvin's Tower

*Play Date: August 29, 2023*

### Over The Wall

In the wake of our harrowing encounter on the beach, I quickly used my [magic snail shell](#enchanted-snail-shell) to communicate with the guard high up in the tower. His urgent advice was clear: "Get off the beach; it's not safe down here." Relaying this message to the group, we wasted no time in scrambling towards the wall.

The guard, whom we learned was named [Simon](#simon), promptly threw a rope ladder over the side for us. [Kuran](#kuran-ardoise), determined not to leave the laughing Sea Gloom behind, struggled to bring the incapacitated creature along as we ascended the wall.

Once atop, I immediately recognized Simon's attire as that of the [Town Guard](#town-guard), the town's crest emblazoned on his chest. Simon shared troubling insights about the rift – it was growing, and peculiar creatures often emerged from it. He mentioned that a group of wizards had been researching the rift but had ceased their efforts after sustaining injuries.

[Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver), drawing upon his knowledge of rifts, suggested that such phenomena usually have a mechanism that keeps them contained, but something was amiss here, allowing this rift to expand unchecked. Intrigued, I inquired about the location of the wizards' research. Simon indicated that there was a locked-up laboratory in town, likely holding more answers. The keys, he believed, were with [Corrine](#sherif-corrine-forton), and [Roberto's](#roberto) body, one of the wizards, had been sent back to Candle Keep, a larger town.

During our conversation, Simon questioned our affiliations, particularly inquiring if we were associated with the Fortons or [Baron Pinkwell](#baron-pinkwell). We clarified our independent status, affirming that we were free agents, beholden to no one.

Simon seemed keen on us meeting Corrine and learning more. He led us to a house by the town's entrance, presumably to facilitate this meeting. As we moved away from the beach, the chaos of the morning hung heavily in the air, but our path forward was becoming increasingly clear – we needed to uncover the mysteries of the rift and understand its growing influence on Haling Cove.

* ash does an arcanda check on the symbols on the floor - NAT - looking at the design on the floor - nothing suggests its some kind of magical rune, doing something to the tower itself - i do notice more closely that there are a fair number of symbols fro mthe fayewilde. the symbol itself suggests -- kind from someone who is actively investigating faye wild or fayewild itself.
* aleric pages through the books on the table.
* the message book has multiple notes about securing boats -- chartering vessels off the coast.
* there are mentions of glass bottles.
* mention of equipment for swimming.
* hooks and rope, series of lenses, 
* belvin was really curious about the comings and goings of hte port or water in the bay/harbor.
* second floor, library
* aleric finds a journal.

Day 42 - picked up a faint ethereal energy signature from one of the tablets off the coast in the bay. It pulsed and thurmmed in time with the moon phases. Connection to the feywild cannot be ruled out.”

Day 57 - got my first look at one of the tablets. the runes etched on it - strange. Old language, forgotten by most, echoes of fey perhaps. Most consult ancient texts.

Day 68: Tablet showed a violent reaction to cold iron today. Same with previous tests involving Fey creatures. Must investigate further.

Day 74: Unsettling dreams since working with the tablet. Whispers of unknown voices, calls from a distant realm? Must tread carefully.

Day 81: Roberto might have been onto something. The spatial and temporal distortions near the tablets could indeed suggest a portal. But where does it lead?

Day 117: Roberto was wrong. We shouldn't move these tablets. Must prevent any further attempts. Too dangerous, too unpredictable.

Day 118: I’ve found the original position for this tablet; will scout tonight to see if we can get it there without the Saesha’sol stopping us.

* ash looks at the sheets of paper strewn about to see what people were writing about before the left.
* one of hte pieces of paper appears to be a letter being written to black staff tower -- a call to keep the tablets in haling cove and not try and relocate them. and not to send anyoen else to try and take them away -- retrieve them.
* the dragon wanted us to find tablets.

remembers something the mist dragon mentioned

“Go to Haling Cove and find the artifacts. The fate of the Cloakwood, the Sea of Swords, and perhaps even Faerun itself hangs in the balance. I would do this task myself, but fear I would draw far too much attention to things that are best left quiet.

“The presence of your Boggle suggests that the situation is worsening, and we can no longer simply watch."

* we look around the room at hte shelves.
* kuran looks over a set of bottles - they have strange materials in them, there are some acids
* potions of transfishgeration
* potions of water breathing
* ash takes a potion of each
* the third floor has a table and a door dividing the room. ash goes to open the door but it is locked.
* kuran comes up to the third floor without george - george lays unoncious to the desk.
* he tries to pick the lock - he disapears to the third floor.
* we enter the room, the atmosphere changes instantly, the room looks new, not dusty.
* the room has a more lived in fealing.
* the most striking feature is a grand piano in the corner.
* most of hte other furniture in the room is simple with magical para. on  them.
* ash looks about at the magical stuff on the furniture.
  * NAT in a drawer i find a similar drift globe, glass sphere, find an older wand that can be used as a focus, overwelciming strongest thing in the room, craziest fealing from the piano. -- or something near the piano.
* aleric goes over to the piano and casts identify on the piano, eyes sinilating, shining.
* aleric plays the piano but some of the keys do not eminate sound.
* aleric gets closer and investigates the keys that don't work properly. the keys themselves are workign but the strings do not vibrate properly.
* he relays to the group.
* lucy rolls her eyes, lifts her hands, and eldridge blasts the piano the blast hits the piano '8' damage, the force topples the piano to its side and it slams into the back wall.
* a huge thud on the inside of hte piano.
* ash goes over and reaches inside the piano to readch for the thing that fell.
* there is a large green stone tablet inside the piano.
* ash wraps it in a cloth and lays it on a table.
* aleric senses the power in the tablet is overwhelming. -- it bridges and touches the fabric of reality. it seems to be corsing with faye magics. this kind of tablet expects it to act like a stitch. used with other tablets to seal a rift.
* the order and spacing of the tablets is critical to maintain the organization of the planes.
* breakign down the tablet would be potent.
* dj3puty finds a loose floor board with a hastily drawn map of the edge of the coast line with 6 markings on it. mostly off the coast, but one in the woods.

* might be matching up to a location on the map that was found.
* kuran joins us and inspects the contraption in the middle of the room.
* doesn't see anything
* aleric comes over and licks the geared mechanism in the room.
* labels on the gears say fayewild, material ,earth, fire, air, water, shadowfell.
* the mechanism doesnt look reputable to ash.
* d3puty studies the thing while we all rest, he notices that the mechanism seems to model the planes and check the alignment.
* kuran notices d3puties movement seems more fluid than normal, or has been. d3puty's face seems more expresive. 

* kuran walks over the d3puty to see what is going on.
* 'you look like a fresh cup of coffee'
* d3puty looks down at himself. looks inward, and notices that he is more limber than he's used too. something feels more fluid.
* d3puty checks if moving from the contraption affects this, but it doesn't.
* kuran notices that a section d3puty's back has a soft green glow to it. kuran picks up a stick and prods d3puties back.
* kuran opens his pack and notices that the tablet has a soft glow to it as well.
* d3puty notes that the tablet might be causing it.
* d3puty is holding it out in front him.
* everyone else wakes up and d3puty relays the nights events. -- including the glow.
* another set of eyes pop out of the side of deputies leg and look around at the other people in the room, and then pops back in.
* 'thats new' thats not me' d3puty checks his leg.
* aleric attempts to check on d3puty but is still tired.
* d3puty looks down at his leg and determine that part of his leg has eyes, a tiny section of his own body has animated into another being that he can communicate with.
* ash becomes curious of what effect it would have on himself.
* lucy has a similar urget to the tablet. ash is nervous knowing this.
* ash wraps the tablet in a heavy curtain adn hands it back to d3puty.
* ash makes a second curtain cape and wraps it around d3puty to try and mask the glow


* we desend the tower and go outside.
* the pigme is awake but bound and towed by kuran.
* ash asks the captain when the last time someone was in there. -- she relays its been at least 20 years.
* we head down to the docks to try and charter a boat.
* ash goes to hte monger to see if they have any chulle repelent. the persons name is 'maxwell'
' i dont know of any chule repelent but as long as you arent using magic they wont bother you ' ... dont use magic fishing hooks, lines, etc.. no wind spells, get stuck out in the water -- they seem to pick up on magic pretty quick. they walk on the bottom, they dont swim on th surface. they can walk up on teh shore. thats about that.
* alaric thinks we should use the transfishguration potion.
* we gather on the docks.
* we gather on two boats
  * boat 1

* aleric points us in the direction of the spot he saw through the telescope
* waves are not particularly strong.
* as we head to seaesh island we see it is lined with wooden spikes and garrisons.
* as we approach the island there appears to be a sand bar.
* everything seems calm on the surface, but when i look down into the water i see large claws, vaguely see some kidn of oversized crab creature that seems to be following our boat.
* i point this out to d3puty and lucy, but we all decide to continue on,
* there is a chule under the water following us.
* we approach a mossy obsidian outcropping
* alaric seems to think this may be for the tablets.
* d3puty wants  to try and swim past chule
* there is a section of the stone in the structure where there appears to be a tile missing.
* ash uses clock on the little guy and he runs back to the docks away from our boats. with haste.

*d3puty is going to head into the water to slot the tablet into the shrine.
* lucy d3puty and kuran jump into the water.
* as the tablet hits the water it glows bright through the cloth and algea and growth starts growing around it, currents start kiking up and water starts to churn and swirl. pushing teh boats away.
* all the peeps in the water are starting to feel a warm fuzzy, almost electrical feeling.
* animal life on the seafloor is awakening, crabs and shrimp are going crazy.
* alaric looks down into the water and it seems there is some kind of bloom in the area, seen or unseen.
* tablet seems to be using the water as a conduit, fae energy is just bleeding out into a large area. farther than it would reach normally.
* d3puty aborts and heads back to the surface.
* lucy uses magic to convince a crab to surface.
* when everyone comes back to the surface they see alaric carassesing the pigme to try and calm it down. he felt bad it was stressed.
 * d3puty resurfaces and tries to hold the ta blet out of the water. the creatures subside when he does that.
* as water drips off the tablet it energizes the fish.
* lucy is swimming in the chummy water, made from the entrails of the crab that was killed.
* **ash gets +1 WIS, +1 nature -1 acrobatics**

* lucy and kuran are swimming down to the site wehere the tablet goes.
* they are looking for markings but arent seeing much
* ash splits ghostly
* alaric picks up the tablet to look closely. he can tell that the tablet has been charged with some very powerful fae and planer magics. the kind that you might use to try and reach across planes. has access to some of the raw fae energy from the fae wwild or the shadowfell. this probably was built this power ful because it is tgrying to hold the planes apart from each other.
* identify: guessing that some of the sheer strength of the artifact anyoen that comes into contact with it is likely to have a temporary effect, especially if they are connected with water or some other teams. sufficient time in close proximity to the tablet, prolonged exposure may cause permanent changes. the fae energies perm. alter the the creatures around it.
* the last bit, haziest bit: expecting that the sheer volume of share energy with a conduit like water is almost enchanting, or calls out to the creatures in the area.
* alaric touches the tablet, 
* ash parts the water with a choral staff left in the boat.
* the boat descends to the oean floor, and sits on the floor.
* aleric starts running with the tablet to the shrine.
* a flash of green light eminates from the tablet as aleric slots the tablet in
* a snap of sound rattles in the distance as its slotted in.
* when the water

* we go back to shore and from the distance it looks like the rift is gone.
* but beyond that but kuran thinks something is going on by the docks.
* over at the docks there is a little bit of outrite chaos going on, torches, yelling, multiple people running around, one of the boats there, the mast is toppled over, appears to be broken. the dock is sinking slightly
* one or two chules are on the docks, attacking hte people, enganged and raging.

<div id="second" style="width:70%; float:left;">

**Habitat:** Cursed Lands, Dark Swamps

**Identification:** The Necrocap Deathspore is a formidable and dangerous mushroom, typically found in areas tainted by dark magic or corruption, such as cursed lands and gloomy swamps. It is characterized by its dark, almost black cap, which has a rough, pockmarked surface resembling decaying flesh. The cap often emits a faint, ominous mist. Its stem is thick and gnarled, covered in a mottled pattern of grey and deep green, giving it a corpse-like appearance.

**Effects and Uses:** The Necrocap Deathspore is infamous for its lethal properties. The mushroom contains potent necrotic toxins that can cause severe damage upon physical contact. Touching the Necrocap Deathspore without proper protection can result in necrotic lesions, where the flesh begins to wither and decay rapidly. The toxins are so virulent that they can cause severe, irreversible tissue damage, and in extreme cases, death.

The Necrocap Deathspore is a perilous hazard for adventurers. It is often found in areas of dark magic and can be used by nefarious characters as a component in deadly poisons or dark rituals.

**Harvesting and Alchemical Use:** Harvesting a Necrocap Deathspore is extremely risky and is typically only attempted by those well-versed in handling deadly substances or by practitioners of dark magic. The mushroom's necrotic properties make it a component in crafting potent necrotic poisons or curses.

* Encounter: Touching a Necrocap Deathspore without protection requires a Constitution saving throw. Failure results in necrotic damage, with severity based on the Dungeon Master's discretion.
* Harvesting: Requires a successful Nature check with specific protective measures. Failure can result in immediate necrotic damage to the harvester.
* Potion Crafting: Used in creating necrotic poisons or dark magical concoctions, requiring a successful Alchemy or Arcana check.

**Folklore and Cultural Significance:** In the lore of many D&D realms, the Necrocap Deathspore is often associated with deities or entities of death, decay, and corruption. It is feared and avoided in most cultures, seen as an omen of death or a manifestation of cursed land. Dark mages and necromancers, however, might seek it for its potent necrotic properties.

The presence of Necrocap Deathspores in an area is usually a sign of deep corruption or an imbalance in the natural order. Their existence is a stark reminder of the destructive power of nature when influenced by dark forces and the thin line between life and death.

**Habitat:** Volcanic Regions, Hot Springs

**Identification:** The Pyroshroom Blazebole is a visually striking mushroom, predominantly found in the scorching landscapes near volcanoes and geothermal vents. Its cap is a vibrant tapestry of reds and oranges, swirling together in a pattern that resembles dancing flames.

**Effects and Uses:** The Pyroshroom Blazebole is infamous for its extreme heat. Consuming even the smallest fragment of this mushroom can trigger an intense, fiery sensation in the consumer. This searing heat is known to temporarily enhance physical strength and adrenaline levels, but it also brings about severe side effects such as dehydration, excessive sweating, and in rare cases, hallucinations induced by the overwhelming spiciness.

The Pyroshroom Blazebole is a high-stakes find for adventurers. It can be used strategically for a temporary boost in combat abilities or to endure extreme cold by increasing the body's internal heat. However, the risks associated with its consumption make it a gamble.

?> **Ash's Note:** Do not give this to [Aleric](#aleric-mysticmind-stoneweaver). He did not have the intestinal fortitude to handle it on previous encounters.

**Harvesting and Alchemical Use:** Harvesting Pyroshroom Blazeboles is a task that demands caution and preparation due to their intense heat. It is recommended to use heat-resistant gloves or magical protection to avoid burns. Alchemists value these mushrooms for creating potions of fire resistance or concoctions that temporarily bolster physical strength. However, mishandling can lead to accidental fires or severe burns.

* **Encounter:** Consuming a Pyroshroom Blazebole requires a *Constitution* saving throw. A successful save grants temporary strength enhancements but causes dehydration, while a failed save leads to severe discomfort and potential hallucinations
* **Harvesting:** A successful Nature check with appropriate protective measures is necessary. Failure can result in taking fire damage.
* **Potion Crafting:** Pyroshroom Blazeboles are key ingredients in fire resistance potions and strength elixirs, requiring a successful *Alchemy* check.

## Somnuscap

<div id="first" style="width:30%; float:left; padding-right:20px;">

</br>
<img src="_images/mushroom-somnuscap.webp" width="100%">
</center></div>
<div id="second" style="width:70%; float:left;">

**Habitat:** Enchanted Forests, Moonlit Clearings

The cap's glow is particularly noticeable under moonlight, making it a beacon in the dark forest. Its stem is gossamer-thin and translucent, often rendering it almost invisible against the forest floor.

**Effects and Uses:** The most remarkable feature of the Somnuscap is its defense mechanism. When disturbed, it releases a cloud of fine spores. These spores have the magical ability to induce a deep, dream-filled sleep in any creature that inhales them. This sleep is not only profound but also restorative, often accompanied by vivid, sometimes prophetic dreams.

The Somnuscap can be a double-edged sword for adventurers. While the induced sleep can provide much-needed rest and recovery, it can also incapacitate a party, leaving them vulnerable to danger. Unwary travelers who inhale a large concentration of spores might find themselves trapped in slumber for extended periods, ranging from days to years in rare cases.

**Harvesting and Alchemical Use:** Harvesting Somnuscap spores is a task for skilled individuals, often requiring knowledge in both botany and magic. The best time to harvest is during the mushroom's dormant phase at dawn, when the release of spores is at its lowest. Alchemists and herbalists value these spores for their unique properties. In controlled, minute quantities, they are an essential ingredient in crafting potent sleeping potions or remedies for those afflicted with relentless nightmares.

* **Encounter:** When disturbing Somnuscap, one must succeed on a *Constitution* saving throw or fall into a magical sleep for a duration.
* **Harvesting:** Requires a successful *Nature* check. A higher rol yields more spores, which an be used or sold.
* **Potion Crafting:** Fabrication of sleep potions from a solution of the spores may require a successful *Arcana* or *Alechemy* check.

**Folklore and Cultural Significance:** The Somnuscap is often intertwined with tales of Morpheus, the deity of dreams. It is seen as a bridge between the waking world and the dream realm, embodying the thin veil that separates reality from fantasy. To many in this world, the Somnuscap is a symbol of nature's enigmatic power and the hidden magic that lies in the ancient forests.

Adventurers who understand the Somnuscap's properties can use it to their advantage, but they must always respect its potent and unpredictable nature.
